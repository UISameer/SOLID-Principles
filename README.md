SOLID Principles in SWIFT

5 principles of Object Oriented Programming.

Single Responsibility Principle
Open Closed
Liskov’s Subsititution
Interface Segregation
Dependency Inversion

These principle solve bad architecture problems like:- 
Delicacy — A change in one place breaks unexpected parts, its difficult to trace if there is no good test coverage.
Immobility — A component is difficult to reuse in another project or use in multiple places of same project, because it has to many dependencies.
Irritable — Takes a lot of effort for change, because it affects several parts.
